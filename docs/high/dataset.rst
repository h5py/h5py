Datasets
========

Datasets are very similar to NumPy arrays.  They are homogenous collections of
data elements, with an immutable datatype and (hyper)rectangular shape.
Unlike NumPy arrays, they support a variety of transparent storage features
such as compression, error-detection, and chunked I/O.

They are represented in h5py by a thin proxy class which supports familiar
NumPy operations like slicing, along with a variety of descriptive attributes:

  - **shape** attribute
  - **size** attribute
  - **dtype** attribute


.. _dataset_create:

Creating datasets
-----------------

New datasets are created using either :meth:`Group.create_dataset` or
:meth:`Group.require_dataset`.  Existing datasets should be retrieved using
the group indexing syntax (``dset = group["name"]``).

To make an empty dataset, all you have to do is specify a name, shape, and
optionally the data type (defaults to ``'f'``)::

    >>> dset = f.create_dataset("default", (100,))
    >>> dset = f.create_dataset("ints", (100,), dtype='i8')

You may initialize the dataset to an existing NumPy array::

    >>> arr = np.arange(100)
    >>> dset = f.create_dataset("init", data=arr)

Keywords ``shape`` and ``dtype`` may be specified along with ``data``; if so,
they will override ``data.shape`` and ``data.dtype``.  It's required that
(1) the total number of points in ``shape`` match the total number of points
in ``data.shape``, and that (2) it's possible to cast ``data.dtype`` to
the requested ``dtype``.


.. _dataset_chunks:

Chunked storage
---------------

An HDF5 dataset created with the default settings will be `contiguous`; in
other words, laid out on disk in traditional C order.  Datasets may also be
created using HDF5's `chunked` storage layout.  This means the dataset is
divided up into regularly-sized pieces which are stored haphazardly on disk,
and indexed using a B-tree.

Chunked storage makes it possible to resize datasets, and because the data
is stored in fixed-size chunks, to use compression filters.

To enable chunked storage, set the keyword ``chunks`` to a tuple indicating
the chunk shape::

    >>> dset = f.create_dataset("chunked", (1000, 1000), chunks=(100, 100))

Data will be read and written in blocks with shape (100,100); for example,
the data in ``dset[0:100,0:100]`` will be stored together in the file, as will
the data points in range ``dset[400:500, 100:200]``.

Chunking has performance implications.  It's recommended to keep the total
size of your chunks between 10 KiB and 1 MiB, larger for larger datasets.
Also keep in mind that when any element in a chunk is accessed, the entire
chunk is read from disk.

Since picking a chunk shape can be confusing, you can have h5py guess a chunk
shape for you::

    >>> dset = f.create_dataset("autochunk", (1000, 1000), chunks=True)

Auto-chunking is also enabled when using compression or ``maxshape``, etc.,
if a chunk shape is not manually specified.


.. _dataset_resize:

Resizable datasets
------------------

In HDF5, datasets can be resized once created up to a maximum size,
by calling :meth:`Dataset.resize`.  You specify this maximum size when creating
the dataset, via the keyword ``maxshape``::

    >>> dset = f.create_dataset("resizable", (10,10), maxshape=(500, 20))

Any (or all) axes may also be marked as "unlimited", in which case they may 
be increased up to the HDF5 per-axis limit of 2**64 elements.  Indicate these
axes using ``None``::

    >>> dset = f.create_dataset("unlimited", (10, 10), maxshape=(None, 10))

.. note:: Resizing an array with existing data works differently than in NumPy; if
    any axis shrinks, the data in the missing region is discarded.  Data does
    not "rearrange" itself as it does when resizing a NumPy array.


.. _dataset_compression:

Filter pipeline
---------------

Chunked data may be transformed by the HDF5 `filter pipeline`.  The most
common use is applying transparent compression.  Data is compressed on the
way to disk, and automatically decompressed when read.  Once the dataset
is created with a particular compression filter applied, data may be read
and written as normal with no special steps required.

Enable compression with the ``compression`` keyword to
:meth:`Group.create_dataset`::

    >>> dset = f.create_dataset("zipped", (100, 100), compression="gzip")

Options for each filter may be specified with ``compression_opts``::

    >>> dset = f.create_dataset("zipped_max", (100, 100), compression="gzip", compression_opts=9)

Lossless compression filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GZIP filter (``"gzip"``)
    Available with every installation of HDF5, so it's best where portability is
    required.  Good compression, moderate speed.  ``compression_opts`` sets the
    compression level and may be an integer from 0 to 9, default is 4.


LZF filter (``"lzf"``)
    Available with every installation of h5py (C source code also available).
    Low to moderate compression, very fast.  No options.


SZIP filter (``"szip"``)
    Patent-encumbered filter used in the NASA community.  Not available with all
    installations of HDF5 due to legal reasons.  Consult the HDF5 docs for filter
    options.

Custom compression filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the compression filters listed above, compression filters can be
dynamically loaded by the underlying HDF5 library. This is done by passing a
filter number to :meth:`Group.create_dataset` as the ``compression`` parameter.
The ``compression_opts`` parameter will then be passed to this filter.

.. note:: The underlying implementation of the compression filter will have the
    ``H5Z_FLAG_OPTIONAL`` flag set. This indicates that if the compression
    filter doesn't compress a block while writing, no error will be thrown. The
    filter will then be skipped when subsequently reading the block.


.. _dataset_scaleoffset:

Scale-Offset filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Filters enabled with the ``compression`` keywords are _lossless_; what comes
out of the dataset is exactly what you put in.  HDF5 also includes a lossy
filter which trades precision for storage space.  

Works with integer and floating-point data only.  Enable the scale-offset
filter by setting :meth:`Group.create_dataset` keyword ``scaleoffset`` to an
integer.  

For integer data, this specifies the number of bits to retain.  Set to 0 to have
HDF5 automatically compute the number of bits required for lossless compression
of the chunk.  For floating-point data, indicates the number of digits after
the decimal point to retain.


.. _dataset_shuffle:

Shuffle filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Block-oriented compressors like GZIP or LZF work better when presented with
runs of similar values.  Enabling the shuffle filter rearranges the bytes in
the chunk and may improve compression ratio.  No significant speed penalty,
lossless.

Enable by setting :meth:`Group.create_dataset` keyword ``shuffle`` to True.


.. _dataset_fletcher32:

Fletcher32 filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adds a checksum to each chunk to detect data corruption.  Attempts to read
corrupted chunks will fail with an error.  No significant speed penalty.
Obviously shouldn't be used with lossy compression filters.

Enable by setting :meth:`Group.create_dataset` keyword ``fletcher32`` to True.


.. _dataset_slicing:

Reading & writing data
----------------------

HDF5 datasets re-use the NumPy slicing syntax to read and write to the file.
Slice specifications are translated directly to HDF5 "hyperslab"
selections, and are a fast and efficient way to access data in the file. The
following slicing arguments are recognized:

    * Indices: anything that can be converted to a Python long
    * Slices (i.e. ``[:]`` or ``[0:10]``)
    * Field names, in the case of compound data
    * At most one ``Ellipsis`` (``...``) object

Here are a few examples (output omitted)

    >>> dset = f.create_dataset("MyDataset", (10,10,10), 'f')
    >>> dset[0,0,0]
    >>> dset[0,2:10,1:9:3]
    >>> dset[:,::2,5]
    >>> dset[0]
    >>> dset[1,5]
    >>> dset[0,...]
    >>> dset[...,6]

For compound data, you can specify multiple field names alongside the
numeric slices:

    >>> dset["FieldA"]
    >>> dset[0,:,4:5, "FieldA", "FieldB"]
    >>> dset[0, ..., "FieldC"]

To retrieve the contents of a `scalar` dataset, you can use the same
syntax as in NumPy:  ``result = dset[()]``.  In other words, index into
the dataset using an empty tuple.

For simple slicing, broadcasting is supported:

    >>> dset[0,:,:] = np.arange(10)  # Broadcasts to (10,10)

Broadcasting is implemented using repeated hyperslab selections, and is
safe to use with very large target selections.  It is supported for the above
"simple" (integer, slice and ellipsis) slicing only.


.. _dataset_fancy:

Fancy indexing
--------------

A subset of the NumPy fancy-indexing syntax is supported.  Use this with
caution, as the underlying HDF5 mechanisms may have different performance
than you expect.

For any axis, you can provide an explicit list of points you want; for a
dataset with shape (10, 10)::

    >>> dset.shape
    (10, 10)
    >>> result = dset[0, [1,3,8]]
    >>> result.shape
    (3,)
    >>> result = dset[1:6, [5,8,9]]
    >>> result.shape
    (5, 3)

The following restrictions exist:

* List selections may not be empty
* Selection coordinates must be given in increasing order
* Duplicate selections are ignored
* Very long lists (> 1000 elements) may produce poor performance

NumPy boolean "mask" arrays can also be used to specify a selection.  The
result of this operation is a 1-D array with elements arranged in the
standard NumPy (C-style) order.  Behind the scenes, this generates a laundry
list of points to select, so be careful when using it with large masks::

    >>> arr = numpy.arange(100).reshape((10,10))
    >>> dset = f.create_dataset("MyDataset", data=arr)
    >>> result = dset[arr > 50]
    >>> result.shape
    (49,)


.. _dataset_iter:

Length and iteration
--------------------

As with NumPy arrays, the ``len()`` of a dataset is the length of the first
axis, and iterating over a dataset iterates over the first axis.  However,
modifications to the yielded data are not recorded in the file.  Resizing a
dataset while iterating has undefined results.

On 32-bit platforms, ``len(dataset)`` will fail if the first axis is bigger
than 2**32. It's recommended to use :meth:`Dataset.len` for large datasets.

Creating and Reading Empty (or Null) datasets and attributes
------------------------------------------------------------

HDF5 has the concept of Empty or Null datasets and attributes. These are not
the same as an array with a shape of (), or a scalar dataspace in HDF5 terms.
Instead, it is a dataset with an associated type, no data, and no shape. In
h5py, we represent this as either a dataset with shape ``None``, or an
instance of ``h5py.Empty``. Empty datasets and attributes cannot be sliced.

To create an empty attribute, use ``h5py.Empty`` as per :ref:`attributes`::

    >>> obj.attrs["EmptyAttr"] = h5py.Empty("f")

Similarly, reading an empty attribute returns ``h5py.Empty``::

    >>> obj.attrs["EmptyAttr"]
    h5py.Empty(dtype="f")

Empty datasets can be created either by defining a ``dtype`` but no
``shape`` in ``create_dataset``::

    >>> grp.create_dataset("EmptyDataset", dtype="f")

or by ``data`` to an instance of ``h5py.Empty``::

    >>> grp.create_dataset("EmptyDataset", data=h5py.Empty("f"))

An empty dataset has shape defined as ``None``, which is the best way of
determining whether a dataset is empty or not. An empty dataset can be "read" in
a similar way to scalar datasets, i.e. if ``empty_dataset`` is an empty
dataset,::

    >>> empty_dataset[()]
    h5py.Empty(dtype="f")

The dtype of the dataset can be accessed via ``<dset>.dtype`` as per normal.
As empty datasets cannot be sliced, some methods of datasets such as
``read_direct`` will raise an exception if used on a empty dataset.

Reference
---------

.. class:: Dataset(identifier)

    Dataset objects are typically created via :meth:`Group.create_dataset`,
    or by retrieving existing datasets from a file.  Call this constructor to
    create a new Dataset bound to an existing 
    :class:`DatasetID <low:h5py.h5d.DatasetID>` identifier.

    .. method:: __getitem__(args)

        NumPy-style slicing to retrieve data.  See :ref:`dataset_slicing`.

    .. method:: __setitem__(args)

        NumPy-style slicing to write data.  See :ref:`dataset_slicing`.

    .. method:: read_direct(array, source_sel=None, dest_sel=None)

        Read from an HDF5 dataset directly into a NumPy array, which can
        avoid making an intermediate copy as happens with slicing. The
        destination array must be C-contiguous and writable, and must have
        a datatype to which the source data may be cast.  Data type conversion
        will be carried out on the fly by HDF5.

        `source_sel` and `dest_sel` indicate the range of points in the
        dataset and destination array respectively.  Use the output of
        ``numpy.s_[args]``::

            >>> dset = f.create_dataset("dset", (100,), dtype='int64')
            >>> arr = np.zeros((100,), dtype='int32')
            >>> dset.read_direct(arr, np.s_[0:10], np.s_[50:60])

    .. method:: astype(dtype)

        Return a context manager allowing you to read data as a particular
        type.  Conversion is handled by HDF5 directly, on the fly::

            >>> dset = f.create_dataset("bigint", (1000,), dtype='int64')
            >>> with dset.astype('int16'):
            ...     out = dset[:]
            >>> out.dtype
            dtype('int16')

    .. method:: resize(size, axis=None)

        Change the shape of a dataset.  `size` may be a tuple giving the new
        dataset shape, or an integer giving the new length of the specified
        `axis`.

        Datasets may be resized only up to :attr:`Dataset.maxshape`.

        Options for the compression filter.  See :ref:`dataset_compression`.

    .. attribute:: scaleoffset

        Setting for the HDF5 scale-offset filter (integer), or None if
        scale-offset compression is not used for this dataset.
        See :ref:`dataset_scaleoffset`.
