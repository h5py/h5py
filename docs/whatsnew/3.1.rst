What's new in h5py 3.1
======================

Bug fixes
---------

* Fix reading numeric data which is not in the native endianness,
  e.g. big-endian data on a little-endian system (:issue:`1729`).
* Fix using bytes as names for :meth:`.Group.create_dataset` and
  :meth:`.Group.create_virtual_dataset` (:issue:`1732`).
* Fix writing data as a list to a dataset with a sub-array data type
  (:issue:`1735`).

Building h5py
-------------

* Allow building against system lzf library by setting ``H5PY_SYSTEM_LZF=1``.
  See :ref:`custom_install`.

Development
-----------

* If pytest is missing `pytest-mpi <https://pytest-mpi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
  it will now fail with a clear error.
* Fix a test which was failing on big-endian systems.
