What's new in h5py 2.10
=======================

New features
------------

- It is now possible to register opaque HDF5 dtypes to be viewed as arrays,
  based on their associated tag, using :func:`register_dtype`. Types used
  like this can also be deregistered with :func:`deregister_dtype`.

- HDF5 8-bit bitfield data can now be read either as uint8 or booleans
  (:issue:`821`). Pytables stores booleans as this type.
  For now, you must pick which type to use explicitly::

      with dset.astype(numpy.uint8):   # or numpy.bool
          arr = dset[:]

- Numpy arrays of integers can now be used for fancy indexing, where previously
  a Python list was required (:issue:`963`).
- Fancy indexing now allows an empty list or array (:issue:`1174`).
- IPython can now tab-complete names in h5py groups and attributes without any
  special user action (:issue:`1228`). This simple completion only matches the
  first level of keys in a group, not subkeys. You can still call
  ``h5py.enable_ipython_completion()`` for more complete results.
- The ``libver`` parameter for :class:`File` now accepts ``'v108'`` and
  ``'v110'`` to specify compatibility with HDF5 1.8 or 1.10 (:issue:`1155`).
  See :ref:`file_version` for details.
- New functions and constants for getting and identifying :ref:`special data
  types <special_types>` - :func:`string_dtype`, :func:`vlen_dtype`,
  :func:`enum_dtype`, ``ref_dtype`` and ``regionref_dtype`` replace
  :func:`special_dtype`. For identifying string, vlen and enum dtypes,
  :func:`check_string_dtype`, :func:`check_vlen_dtype` and
  :func:`check_enum_dtype` replace :func:`check_dtype` (:issue:`1132`).
- A new method :meth:`~.Dataset.make_scale` to conveniently make a dataset into
  a :ref:`dimension scale <dimension_scales>` (:issue:`830`, :issue:`1212`).
- Several examples were updated to run on Python 3 (:issue:`1149`).

Deprecations
------------

- The default behaviour of ``h5py.File`` with no specified mode is deprecated
  (:issue:`1143`).
  It currently tries to create a file or open it for read/write access,
  silently falling back to read-only depending on permissions. From h5py 3.0,
  the default will be read-only.

  Ideally, code should pass an explicit mode each time a file is opened.
  If that is not practical, and you want to suppress the deprecation warnings,
  you can either:

   - set ``h5.get_config().default_file_mode = 'r'`` (or another available mode)
   - or set the environment variable ``H5PY_DEFAULT_READONLY`` to any non-empty
     string, to adopt the future default.

- This is expected to be the last h5py release to support Python 2.7 and 3.4.

Exposing HDF5 functions
-----------------------

- ``H5Zunregister`` exposed as :func:`h5z.unregister_filter` (:issue:`746`,
  :issue:`1224`).

Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed random selection of data type when reading 64-bit floats on Windows
  where Python uses random dictionary order (:issue:`1051`, :issue:`1134`).
- Pickling h5py objects now fails explicitly. It previously failed on
  unpickling, and we can't reliably serialise and restore handles to HDF5
  objects anyway (:issue:`531`, :issue:`1194`). If you need to use these objects
  in other processes, you could explicitly serialise the filename and the name
  of the object inside the file. Or consider `h5pickle
  <https://github.com/Exteris/h5pickle/>`_, which does the same implicitly.
- Creating a dataset with external storage can no longer mutate the ``external``
  list parameter passed in (:issue:`1205`). It also has improved error messages
  (:issue:`1204`).
- Certain deprecation warnings will now show the relevant line of code which
  uses the deprecated feature (:issue:`1146`).
- Skipped a failing test for complex floating point numbers on 32-bit x86
  systems (:issue:`1235`).
- Documented that nested compound types are not currently supported
  (:issue:`1236`).

Building h5py
-------------

- The version of HDF5 can now be automatically detected on Windows
  (:issue:`1123`).
- Building h5py from source on Unix platforms now requires either ``pkg-config``
  or an explicitly specified path to HDF5 (:issue:`1231`).
  Previously it had a hardcoded default path, but when this was wrong,
  the failures were unnecessarily confusing.
- The Cython 'language level' is now explicitly set to 2, to prepare h5py
  for changing defaults in Cython (:issue:`1171`).

Development
-----------

h5py's tests are now run by pytest (:issue:`1003`), and coverage reports are
automatically generated `on Codecov <https://codecov.io/gh/h5py/h5py>`_.
