Experimental support for Single Writer Multiple Reader (SWMR)
-------------------------------------------------------------

This release introduces experimental support for the highly-anticipated
"Single Writer Multiple Reader" (SWMR) feature in the upcoming HDF5 1.10
release.  SWMR allows sharing of a single HDF5 file between multiple processes
without the complexity of MPI or multiprocessing-based solutions.

This is an experimental feature that should NOT be used in production code.
We are interested in getting feedback from the broader community with respect
to performance and the API design.

For more details, check out the h5py user guide:
http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/swmr.html

SWMR support was contributed by Ulrik Pedersen (`#551`_).
