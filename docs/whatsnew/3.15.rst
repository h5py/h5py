What's new in h5py 3.15
=======================

New features
------------

* Added pre-built packages for Python 3.14 (:pr:`2617`).
* Added pre-built packages for Windows on ARM devices (:pr:`2653`).
* Added pre-built packages for Linux with musl libc, such as Alpine Linux, on both
  both ``x86_64`` and ``aarch64`` architectures (:pr:`2632`). See :pep:`656` for
  the details of the ``musllinux`` platform tag.
* :meth:`h5py.Dataset.iter_chunks` accepts slice objects with the ``None`` value
  for ``slice.start`` and ``slice.stop`` attributes, or integers (:pr:`2657`).
  Example: ``dset.iter_chunks((slice(None, None), 4))``. This is equivalent to
  ``dset[:,4]``.
* A new `track_times` parameter when creating a group or a file to control
  whether creation, modification, change and access timestamps are stored
  for group objects (:pr:`2611`). This is False by default.
* Work to better support free-threaded mode in CPython (:pr:`2658`, :pr:`2678`).
  This is not substantially tested yet, but some of the most glaring issues
  have been resolved. See :ref:`free_threading`.

Breaking Changes and Deprecations
---------------------------------

* Support for Python 3.9 was dropped. Python 3.10 or newer is now required
  to build or install h5py from this version on (:pr:`2640`).
* The minimum supported version of HDF5 is now 1.10.7, and within the 1.12 series
  the minimum supported version is now 1.12.1 (:pr:`2605`).
* Timestamps are no longer stored by default for groups (including the root group)
  if the ``track_order`` parameter is set (:pr:`2611`). Previously, setting this
  parameter also caused timestamps to be stored in the file.
* Pre-emptively fix build issue with Numpy 10 or above (:pr:`2638`).

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed ``h5py.h5p.PropLAID.get_elink_prefix`` method (:pr:`2712`).
* Fixed a segfault reading unallocated variable length string data as NumPy
  variable length strings (:pr:`2630`).
* Fixed some SyntaxWarnings which might become errors in a future Python version
  (:pr:`2597`).

Building h5py
-------------

* The minimum versions build-time Python requirements were updated to
  ``Cython==3.0.0`` (up from ``0.29.1``, :pr:`2647`), and ``numpy==1.25.0``
  (down from ``2.0.0``, :pr:`2646`). We still recommend building with numpy 2 or
  newer whenever possible, this is done to improve support for external package
  ecosystems, where the system uses the same version of packages for building
  and installation.
* Deprecated Cython preproc macros (``DEF``, ``IF``, ``ELIF`` and ``ELSE``)
  were replaced with build-time ``tempita``-based templating (:pr:`2637`).
* Some work to support building h5py with HDF5 2.0 development versions
  (:pr:`2636`).
* Building h5py using the standard Python mechanisms now uses a custom build
  backend within the source folder, wrapping setuptools, to avoid the use of the
  deprecated ``setup_requires`` parameter (:pr:`2659`).
