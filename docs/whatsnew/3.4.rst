What's new in h5py 3.4
======================

New features
------------

* The pre-built wheels now bundle HDF5 1.12.1 (:pr:`1945`).
* ``len()`` now works on ``dset.astype()``, ``.asstr()`` and ``.fields()``
  wrappers (:pr:`1913`).

Bug fixes
---------

* Fix bug introduced in version 3.3 that did not allow the creation of files
  using the flag "a" for certain drivers (e.g. mpiio, core and stdio)
  (:pr:`1922`).
* Dataset indexing will now use the optimized fast path, which was accidentally
  disabled in a previous version (:pr:`1944`).
* Fix an error building with Cython 3.0 alpha 8 (``cpdef`` inside functions)
  (:pr:`1923`).
