What's new in h5py 2.6
======================

Support for HDF5 Virtual Dataset API
------------------------------------
Initial support for the HDF5 Virtual Dataset API, which was introduced in
HDF5 1.10, was added to the low-level API. Ideas and input for how this should
work as part of the high-level interface are welcome.

This work was added in `#663`_ by Aleksandar Jelenak.

Add MPI Collective I/O Support
------------------------------
Support for using MPI Collective I/O in both low-level and high-level code has
been added. See the collective_io.py example for a simple demonstration of how
to use MPI Collective I/O with the high level API.

This work was added in `#648`_ by Jialin Liu.

Numerous build/testing/CI improvements
--------------------------------------
There were a number of improvements to the setup.py file, which should mean that
`pip install h5py` should work in most places. Work was also done to clean up
the current testing system, using tox is the recommended way of testing h5py
across different Python versions. See `#576`_ by Jakob Lombacher, `#640`_ by
Lawrence Mitchell, and `#650`_, `#651`_ and `#658`_ by James Tocknell.

Cleanup of codebase based on pylint
-----------------------------------
There was a large cleanup of pylint-identified problems by Andrew Collette
(`#578`_, `#579`_).

Fixes to low-level API
----------------------
Fixes to the typing of functions were added in `#597`_ by Ulrik Kofoed
Pedersen, `#589`_ by Peter Chang, and `#625`_ by Spaghetti Sort. A fix for
variable-length arrays was added in `#621`_ by Sam Mason. Fixes to compound
types were added in `#639`_ by @nevion and `#606`_ by Yu Feng. Finally, a fix
to type conversion was added in `#614`_ by Andrew Collette.
