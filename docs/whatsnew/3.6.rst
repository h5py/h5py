What's new in h5py 3.6
======================

New features
------------

* Pre-built packages are now available for Python 3.10.

Deprecations
------------

* Using :meth:`.Dataset.astype` as a context manager (``with dset.astype(t):``)
  is deprecated. Slice the object returned by astype instead
  (``data = dset.astype(t)[:10]``). This works from h5py 3.0 onwards.
* Getting the value of ``h5py.get_config().default_file_mode`` now issues a
  deprecation warning. This has been ``'r'`` by default from h5py 3.0, and
  cannot be changed since 3.3.

Building h5py
-------------

* h5py now requires the ``oldest-supported-numpy`` package at build time,
  instead of maintaining its own list of the oldest supported NumPy versions.
  The effect should be similar, but hopefully more reliable.

Development
-----------

* The custom ``setup.py test`` has been removed.
  `tox <https://tox.wiki/en/latest/>`_ should be used instead during
  development (see :ref:`contrib-run-tests`), and ``pytest --pyargs h5py`` can
  be used to test h5py after installation.
