What's new in h5py 2.1
======================

Dimension scales
----------------

H5py now supports the Dimension Scales feature of HDF5!  Thanks to Darren
Dale for implementing this.  You can find more information on using scales
in the :ref:`dimension_scales` section of the docs.

Unicode strings allowed in attributes
-------------------------------------

Group, dataset and attribute names in h5py 2.X can all be given as unicode.
Now, you can also store (scalar) unicode data in attribute values as well::

    >>> myfile.attrs['x'] = u"I'm a Unicode string!"

Storing Unicode strings in datasets or as members of compound types is not
yet implemented.

Dataset size property
---------------------

Dataset objects now expose a ``.size`` property which provides the total
number of elements in the dataspace.

``Dataset.value`` property is now deprecated.
---------------------------------------------

The property ``Dataset.value``, which dates back to h5py 1.0, is deprecated
and will be removed in a later release.  This property dumps the entire
dataset into a NumPy array.  Code using ``.value`` should be updated to use
NumPy indexing, using ``mydataset[...]`` or ``mydataset[()]`` as appropriate.

Bug fixes
---------

    * Object and region references were sometimes incorrectly wrapped wrapped
      in a ``numpy.object_`` instance (issue 202)
    * H5py now ignores old versions of Cython (<0.13) when building
      (issue 221)
    * Link access property lists weren't being properly tracked in the high
      level interface (issue 212)
    * Race condition fixed in identifier tracking which led to Python crashes
      (issue 151)
    * Highlevel objects will now complain if you try to bind them to the wrong
      HDF5 object types (issue 191)
    * Unit tests can now be run after installation (issue 201)
