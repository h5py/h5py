Installation
============


For Python beginners
--------------------

It can be a pain to install NumPy, HDF5, h5py, Cython and other dependencies.
If you're just starting out, by far the easiest approach is to install h5py via
your package manager (``apt-get`` or similar), or by using one of the major
science-oriented Python distributions:

* `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ (Linux, Mac, Windows)
* `PythonXY <https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/>`_ (Windows)


Installing on Windows
---------------------

You will need:

  * Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3 or 3.4
  * NumPy 1.6.1 or newer

Download the installer from http://www.h5py.org and run it.  HDF5 is
included.

If Anaconda Python is installed, plese use:
  conda install h5py

Installing on Linux and Mac OS X
--------------------------------

System dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need:

* Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, or 3.4 with development headers (``python-dev`` or similar)
* HDF5 1.8.4 or newer, shared library version with development headers (``libhdf5-dev`` or similar)

On Mac OS X, `homebrew <http://brew.sh>`_ is a reliable way of getting
Python, HDF5 and other dependencies set up.  It is also safe to use h5py
with the OS X system Python.

Install with pip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simply run::

    $ pip install h5py
    
All dependencies are installed automatically.

Via setup.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need:

* The h5py tarball from http://www.h5py.org.
* NumPy 1.6.1 or newer
* `Cython <http://cython.org>`_ 0.17 or newer

::

    $ tar xzf h5py-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
    $ cd h5py
    $ python setup.py install


Running the test suite
----------------------

With the tarball version of h5py::

    $ python setup.py build
    $ python setup.py test

After installing h5py::

    >>> import h5py
    >>> h5py.run_tests()


Custom installation
-------------------

You can specify build options for h5py with the ``configure`` option to
setup.py.  Options may be given together or separately::

    $ python setup.py configure --hdf5=/path/to/hdf5
    $ python setup.py configure --hdf5-version=X.Y.Z
    $ python setup.py configure --mpi
    
Note the ``--hdf5-version`` option is generally not needed, as h5py 
auto-detects the installed version of HDF5 (even for custom locations).

Once set, build options apply to all future builds in the source directory.
You can reset to the defaults with the ``--reset`` option::

    $ python setup.py configure --reset

You can also configure h5py using environment variables.  This is handy
when installing via ``pip``, as you don't have direct access to setup.py::

    $ HDF5_DIR=/path/to/hdf5 pip install h5py
    $ HDF5_VERSION=X.Y.Z pip install h5py
    
Here's a list of all the configure options currently supported:

======================= =========================== ===========================
Option                  Via setup.py                Via environment variable
======================= =========================== ===========================
Custom path to HDF5     ``--hdf5=/path/to/hdf5``    ``HDF5_DIR=/path/to/hdf5``
Force HDF5 version      ``--hdf5-version=X.Y.Z``    ``HDF5_VERSION=X.Y.Z``
Enable MPI mode         ``--mpi``                   (none)
======================= =========================== ===========================


Building against Parallel HDF5
------------------------------

If you just want to build with ``mpicc``, and don't care about using Parallel
HDF5 features in h5py itself::

    $ export CC=mpicc
    $ python setup.py install

If you want access to the full Parallel HDF5 feature set in h5py
(:ref:`parallel`), you will have to build in MPI mode.  Right now this must
be done with command-line options from the h5py tarball.

**You will need a shared-library build of Parallel HDF5 (i.e. built with
./configure --enable-shared --enable-parallel).**

To build in MPI mode, use the ``--mpi`` option to ``setup.py configure``::

    $ export CC=mpicc
    $ python setup.py configure --mpi
    $ python setup.py build

See also :ref:`parallel`.


Help! It didn't work!
---------------------

You may wish to check the :ref:`faq` first for common installation problems.

Then, feel free to ask the discussion group
`at Google Groups <http://groups.google.com/group/h5py>`_. There's
only one discussion group for h5py, so you're likely to get help directly
from the maintainers.
