HDF5 for Python
###############

The `HDF5 library <http://www.hdfgroup.com/HDF5>`_ is a versatile,
mature library designed for the storage
of numerical data.  The h5py package provides a simple, Pythonic interface to
HDF5.  A straightforward high-level interface allows the manipulation of
HDF5 files, groups and datasets using established Python and NumPy metaphors.

Additionally, the library offers a low-level interface which exposes the 
majority of the HDF5 C API in a Pythonic, object-oriented fashion.  This
interface is documented in the :ref:`low-level API reference <api_ref>`.
