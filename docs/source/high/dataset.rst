Datasets
========

Datasets are very similar to NumPy arrays.  They are homogenous collections of
data elements, with an immutable datatype and (hyper)rectangular shape.
Unlike NumPy arrays, they support a variety of transparent storage features
such as compression, error-detection, and chunked I/O.

They are represented in h5py by a thin proxy class which supports familiar
NumPy operations like slicing, along with a variety of descriptive attributes.

Datasets are created using either :meth:`Group.create_dataset` or
:meth:`Group.require_dataset`.  Existing datasets should be retrieved using
the group indexing syntax (``dset = group["name"]``).

NumPy compatibility
-------------------

Datasets implement the following parts of the NumPy-array user interface:

  - Slicing:  simple indexing and a subset of advanced indexing
  - **shape** attribute
  - **dtype** attribute

.. _dsetfeatures:

Special features
----------------

Unlike memory-resident NumPy arrays, HDF5 datasets support a number of optional
features which control how the data is stored on disk.  These are enabled by
the keywords provided to :meth:`Group.create_dataset`.  Some of the more
useful are:

Chunked storage
    HDF5 can store data in "chunks" indexed by B-trees, as well as in the
    traditional contiguous manner.  This can dramatically increase I/O
    performance for certain patterns of access; for example, reading every
    n-th element along the fastest-varying dimension.

Compression
    Transparent lossless compression can substantially reduce
    the storage space needed for the dataset.  Beginning with h5py 1.1,
    three techniques are available, "gzip", "lzf" and "szip". See the
    ``filters`` module for more information.
    
Scale/offset storage & lossy compression
    HDF5 1.8 introduces compression based on truncation to
    a fixed number of bits after scaling and shifting data. This can be
    used, for instance, to do the following:
    
      - Losslessly store 12-bit integer data using only 12 bits of storage
        per value.
      - Lossily store 16-bit integer data using 12 bits of storage per
        value.
      - Lossily store floating-point data with a fixed number of
        digits after the decimal place.
        
    See the ``scaleoffset`` argument to :meth:`Group.create_dataset` for more
    information.

Error-Detection
    All versions of HDF5 include the *fletcher32* checksum filter, which enables
    read-time error detection for datasets.  If part of a dataset becomes
    corrupted, a read operation on that section will immediately fail with
    an exception.

Resizing
    Datasets can be resized, up to a maximum value provided at creation time.
    You can specify this maximum size via the *maxshape* argument to
    :meth:`create_dataset <Group.create_dataset>` or
    :meth:`require_dataset <Group.require_dataset>`. Shape elements with the
    value ``None`` indicate unlimited dimensions.

    Later calls to :meth:`Dataset.resize` will modify the shape in-place::

        >>> dset = grp.create_dataset("name", (10,10), '=f8', maxshape=(None, None))
        >>> dset.shape
        (10, 10)
        >>> dset.resize((20,20))
        >>> dset.shape
        (20, 20)

.. note:: Resizing an array with existing data works differently than in NumPy; if
    any axis shrinks, the data in the missing region is discarded.  Data does
    not "rearrange" itself as it does when resizing a NumPy array.

.. _slicing_access:

Slicing access
--------------

The best way to get at data is to use the traditional NumPy extended-slicing
syntax.   Slice specifications are translated directly to HDF5 *hyperslab*
selections, and are a fast and efficient way to access data in the file. The
following slicing arguments are recognized:

    * Numbers: anything that can be converted to a Python long
    * Slices (i.e. ``[:]`` or ``[0:10]``)
    * Field names, in the case of compound data
    * At most one ``Ellipsis`` (``...``) object

Here are a few examples (output omitted)

    >>> dset = f.create_dataset("MyDataset", (10,10,10), 'f')
    >>> dset[0,0,0]
    >>> dset[0,2:10,1:9:3]
    >>> dset[:,::2,5]
    >>> dset[0]
    >>> dset[1,5]
    >>> dset[0,...]
    >>> dset[...,6]

For compound data, you can specify multiple field names alongside the
numeric slices:

    >>> dset["FieldA"]
    >>> dset[0,:,4:5, "FieldA", "FieldB"]
    >>> dset[0, ..., "FieldC"]

.. note::

    To retrieve the contents of a `scalar` dataset, you can use the same
    syntax as in NumPy:  ``result = dset[()]``.  In other words, index into
    the dataset using an empty tuple.

Broadcasting
------------

For simple slicing, broadcasting is supported:

    >>> dset[0,:,:] = np.arange(10)  # Broadcasts to (10,10)

Importantly, h5py does *not* use NumPy to do broadcasting before the write.
Broadcasting is implemented using repeated hyperslab selections, and is
safe to use with very large target selections.  In the following example, a
write from a (1000, 1000) array is broadcast to a (1000, 1000, 1000) target
selection as a series of 1000 writes:

    >>> dset2 = f.create_dataset("MyDataset", (1000,1000,1000), 'f')
    >>> data = np.arange(1000*1000, dtype='f').reshape((1000,1000))
    >>> dset2[:] = data  # Does NOT allocate 3.8 G of memory

Broadcasting is supported for "simple" (integer, slice and ellipsis) slicing
only.


Coordinate lists
----------------

For any axis, you can provide an explicit list of points you want; for a
dataset with shape (10, 10)::

    >>> dset.shape
    (10, 10)
    >>> result = dset[0, [1,3,8]]
    >>> result.shape
    (3,)
    >>> result = dset[1:6, [5,8,9]]
    >>> result.shape
    (5, 3)

The following restrictions exist:

* List selections may not be empty
* Selection coordinates must be given in increasing order
* Duplicate selections are ignored

.. _sparse_selection:

Sparse selection
----------------

Additional mechanisms exist for the case of scattered and/or sparse selection,
for which slab or row-based techniques may not be appropriate.

NumPy boolean "mask" arrays can be used to specify a selection.  The result of
this operation is a 1-D array with elements arranged in the standard NumPy
(C-style) order:

    >>> arr = numpy.arange(100).reshape((10,10))
    >>> dset = f.create_dataset("MyDataset", data=arr)
    >>> result = dset[arr > 50]
    >>> result.shape
    (49,)

Length and iteration
--------------------

As with NumPy arrays, the ``len()`` of a dataset is the length of the first
axis, and iterating over a dataset iterates over the first axis.  However,
modifications to the yielded data are not recorded in the file.  Resizing a
dataset while iterating has undefined results.

.. note::

    On 32-bit platforms, len() will fail if the first axis is bigger than 2**32.
    You can use the method ``dataset.len()`` to get around this.
