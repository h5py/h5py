Reporting bugs
==============

Bug reports are always welcome!


If you're unsure whether you've found a bug
-------------------------------------------

Always feel free to ask on the mailing list (h5py at Google Groups).  Discussions
there are seen by lots of people and are archived by Google.  Even if the
issue you're having isn't a bug in h5py, other people can benefit from a
record of the conversation.


Making a bug report
-------------------

You can report a bug at the GitHub (http://github.com/h5py/h5py) page for
h5py.  When doing so, please include as much information as possible; a
good way to do this is by including the contents of ``h5py.version.info``::

    >>> import h5py
    >>> print h5py.version.info
