HDF5 for Python
===============

The h5py package is a Pythonic interface to the HDF5 binary data format.

`HDF5 <http://hdfgroup.org>`_ lets you store huge amounts of numerical
data, and easily manipulate that data from NumPy. For example, you can slice
into multi-terabyte datasets stored on disk, as if they were real NumPy
arrays. Thousands of datasets can be stored in a single file, categorized and
tagged however you want.
