h5py Low-Level API Reference
============================


This documentation contains the auto-generated API information for the
h5py |release| "low-level" interface, a collection of Cython modules
which form the interface to the HDF5 C library.  It's hosted separately from
our main documentation as it requires autodoc.

.. note::

   The main docs for h5py are at https://docs.h5py.org.
   The docs here are specifically for the h5py low-level interface.
