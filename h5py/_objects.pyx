"""
    Implements ObjectID base class and global object registry.

    It used to be that we could store the HDF5 identifier in an ObjectID
    and simply close it when the object was deallocated.  However, since
    HDF5 1.8.5 they have started recycling object identifiers, which
    breaks this system.

    We now use a global registry of object identifiers.  This is implemented
    via a dictionary which maps an integer representation of the identifier
    to a weak reference of an ObjectID.  There is only one ObjectID instance
    in the universe for each integer identifier.  When the HDF5 reference
    count for a identifier reaches zero, HDF5 closes the object and reclaims
    the identifier. When this occurs, the identifier and weak reference must
    be deleted from the registry. If an ObjectID is deallocated, it is deleted
    from the registry and the HDF5 reference count is decreased, HDF5 closes
    and reclaims the identifier for future use.

    All interactions with the registry must be synchronized for thread safety.
    You must acquire "registry.lock" before interacting with the registry. The
    registry is not internally synchronized, in the interest of performance: we
    don't want the same thread attempting to acquire the lock multiple times
    during a single operation, if we can avoid it.

    All ObjectIDs and subclasses thereof should be opened with the "open"
    classmethod factory function, such that an existing ObjectID instance can
    be returned from the registry when appropriate.
