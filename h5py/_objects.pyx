# --- Locking code ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Most of the functions and methods in h5py spend all their time in the Cython
# code for h5py, and hold the GIL until they exit.  However, in some cases,
# particularly when calling native-Python functions from the stdlib or
# elsewhere, the GIL can be released mid-function and another thread can
# call into the API at the same time.
#
# This is bad news, especially for the object identifier registry.
#
# We serialize all access to the low-level API with a single recursive lock.
# Only one thread at a time can call any low-level routine.
#
# Note that this doesn't affect other applications like PyTables which are
# interacting with HDF5.  In the case of the identifier registry, this means
# that it's possible for an identifier to go stale and for PyTables to reuse
# it before we've had a chance to set obj.id = 0.  For this reason, h5py is
# advertised for EITHER multithreaded use OR use alongside PyTables/NetCDF4,
# but not both at the same time.

# --- End locking code --------------------------------------------------------


# --- Registry code ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# With HDF5 1.8, when an identifier is closed its value may be immediately
# re-used for a new object.  This leads to odd behavior when an ObjectID
# with an old identifier is left hanging around... for example, a GroupID
# belonging to a closed file could suddenly "mutate" into one from a
# different file.
#
# There are two ways such "zombie" identifiers can arise.  The first is if
# an identifier is explicitly closed via obj._close().  For this case we
# set obj.id = 0.  The second is that certain actions in HDF5 can *remotely*
# invalidate identifiers.  For example, closing a file opened with
# H5F_CLOSE_STRONG will also close open groups, etc.
#
# When such a "nonlocal" event occurs, we have to examine all live ObjectID
# instances, and manually set obj.id = 0.  That's what the function
# nonlocal_close() does.  We maintain an inventory of all live ObjectID
# instances in the registry dict.  Then, when a nonlocal event occurs,
# nonlocal_close() walks through the inventory and sets the stale identifiers
# to 0.  It must be explictly called; currently, this happens in FileID.close()
# as well as the high-level File.close().
#
# The entire low-level API is now explicitly locked, so only one thread at at
# time is taking actions that may create or invalidate identifiers. See the
# "locking code" section above.
#
# See also __cinit__ and __dealloc__ for class ObjectID.
