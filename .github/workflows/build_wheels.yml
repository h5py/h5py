# Adapted from https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/main/.github/workflows/nightlies.yml
# and https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/setup/#github-actions

# 1. Move as much as possible to pyproject.toml instead of using env vars
# 2. Use native compiling for macOS via -13 (Intel) and -14 (arm) runners
# 3. For aarch64, only ever test py312 and skip testing other python versions
#    (for speed).
# 4. Split aarch64 python version builds over jobs, for all other systems/archs build
#    wheels for all Python versions in a single job (for speed).
# 5. On pushes, build and test all wheels and push as release artifacts (in
#    draft mode for main branch pushes).
# 6. On scheduled runs, build and test all wheels against
#    scientific-python-nightly-wheels NumPy dev, then upload the resulting wheels there.
# 7. On PRs, only build one aarch64 wheel (for speed).
# 8. On PRs, build against NumPy dev if [pip-pre] is in the commit message.
# 9. On PRs, build all aarch64 variants if [aarch64] is in the commit message.
