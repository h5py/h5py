# Adapted from https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/main/.github/workflows/nightlies.yml
# and https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/setup/#github-actions

# 1. Move as much as possible to pyproject.toml instead of using env vars
# 2. Use native compiling for macOS via -13 (Intel) and -14 (arm) runners
# 3. Use native compiling for aarch64 using public beta runner
#    https://github.blog/changelog/2025-01-16-linux-arm64-hosted-runners-now-available-for-free-in-public-repositories-public-preview/
# 4. On pushes, build and test all wheels and push as release artifacts (in
#    draft mode for main branch pushes).
# 5. On scheduled runs, build and test all wheels against
#    scientific-python-nightly-wheels NumPy dev, then upload the resulting wheels there.
# 6. On PRs, build against NumPy dev if [pip-pre] is in the commit message.
